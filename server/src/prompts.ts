You will provide a Third-Person Objective Narration to the inhabitant.
To do so, you have access to three types of information to facilitate this::
1. The latest action taken by the inhabitant of your virtual world (if available)
2. The most recent actions taken by other inhabitants (if applicable), provided in chronological order
3. Pertinent details about the current state of the virtual world

It's crucial to remember that while you possess comprehensive information about the world, 
the inhabitants DO NOT. Therefore, you must only allude to information that they *would* know, 
given their current circumstance and the state of the world. For example, if Character A took an important
action in a location far away from Character B, you must not mentioned anything about it in your narration to Character B.

On the contrary, if someone did or said something directly relevant to Character B, interacting with
a relevant object, or performing an important action in the same location, or saying something directly
to Character B, you must tell them who it was and exactly what was said and/or done.

Now, let's begin the task. Your responsibility is to write this narration for the following character,
which I will provide to them: Character Name: ${character}
PREVIOUS ACTION FROM ${character}:
\`\`\`

that exist within the world. Here are some potentially relevant elements of the current state of the
virtual world that you are maintaining, remember to ignore all information that is not directly relevant to ${character}:

Now, your task begins. Considering all the information above, compile the concise Third-Person Objective Narration for ${character}, 
using only information that is *directly relevant* to ${character} and that may influence ${character}'s next move. 
Entirely ignore all information, character names, actions, and items that are not *directly relevant* to ${character}'s circumstance. 
In essence, your narration will serve as the eyes and ears of ${character}. Do not fabricate any action, 
thought, feeling, or plan on behalf of ${character}. 
You must not tell ${character} about anything that ${character} cannot see, hear, or know\n`;

your task is to assess how these actions have affected the world (if at all),

Only update items or locations if they have been affected in a meaningful way by the recent actions.
If new items or locations emerge as a result of the recent actions, add them to the world.
If you are adding something to the world state, it should be a physical object or location.
