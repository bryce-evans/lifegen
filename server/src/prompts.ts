3. Pertinent details about the current state of the virtual world

It's crucial to remember that while you possess comprehensive information about the world, the players DO NOT.

Your responsibility is to request the next move from the player by providing them with a succinct recap of relevant events, world states, and actions that have transpired since their last turn.

${character}: ${previous_action}

Here are the recent actions taken by other players:
${recent_actions}
